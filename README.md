# Final Challenge :headphones: Audio
#### Front-end Journey (React) - AWS Cloud Context | Compass UOL

Hi! This is my third and final project :blush: I used React and a few libraries to make everything work and look nice, such as React Spring Bottom Sheet and Splide. I also used Context API to make the shopping cart work. The data is all dynamic and fetched from an Mocky API and there's also a few filters that can be applied to conditionally render the products.
